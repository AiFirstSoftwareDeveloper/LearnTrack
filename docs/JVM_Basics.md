# ☕ JVM – Java Virtual Machine

The JVM is a virtual machine that runs Java programs.

### What it does
- Converts Bytecode into machine code
- Manages memory (Heap, Stack)
- Handles garbage collection
- Makes Java platform independent

Note : JVM does not understand Java code directly.
It only understands bytecode (.class files).

# 📦 JRE – Java Runtime Environment

The JRE provides everything needed to run a Java application.

### What it contains
- JVM
- Java class libraries (java.lang, java.util, etc.)
- Supporting files

# 🛠️ JDK – Java Development Kit

The JDK is a complete toolkit for Java developers.

### What it contains

- JRE
- JVM
- Development tools:
  - javac (compiler)
  - java (launcher)
  - javadoc
  - jar
  - debugger, etc.

### What you can do with JDK

- Write Java code
- Compile Java code
- Run Java programs

# What is bytecode
### Bytecode is an intermediate, platform-independent code generated by the Java compiler (javac) from Java source files (.java) and stored in .class files, which is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

- It is not Java source code
- It is not machine code
- It is meant to be executed by the JVM

## 🔑 Key points

- Generated after compilation, before execution
- Same bytecode runs on any OS with a compatible JVM
- Not directly executed by the CPU
- Enables Java’s “Write Once, Run Anywhere” principle

# “Write once, run anywhere”
#### “Write once, run anywhere” (WORA) means that a Java program is written and compiled only once, and the same compiled output (bytecode) can run on any operating system or hardware without modification, as long as a compatible Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is available.
#### This is possible because Java source code is compiled into platform-independent bytecode, and the JVM—being platform-specific—handles the conversion of that bytecode into native machine code for the underlying system, shielding developers from OS and hardware differences.
